    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Are you aware of all the changes in the private aviation market?  How do you separate the hype from the reality?

-Private aviation apps
-New membership programs
-Fractional fleet refreshments
-Shrinking pilot workforce

Aviation Portfolio proactively, and in real-time, advises on solutions and adjustments that give buyers an advantage in decision-making around private aviation.

Can we schedule 5 minutes to discuss your overall aviation strategy?
