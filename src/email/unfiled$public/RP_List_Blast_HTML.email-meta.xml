    <subject>Introducing Aviation Portfolio</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},  

Are your private aviation needs being met in the most efficient manner?  

Aviation Portfolio, an independent, private aviation intelligence company, was created to tackle this challenge.  

And to illustrate how valuable our service is, we are offering a COMPLIMENTARY historical audit during the month of October.  

Craig Ross, the former COO of Marquis Jet, founded Aviation Portfolio in 2011.  The company currently employs a staff of five and has offices in California and New York.  Can we schedule five minutes to discuss?  

Best Regards,  
Luke Hatfield
