    <subject>Introducing Aviation Portfolio</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Aviation Portfolio, an independent, private aviation intelligence company, has become a valuable resource to corporate flight departments.

And to illustrate the value of our support and protection, we are offering a COMPLIMENTARY historical audit during the month of October.

Craig Ross, the former COO of Marquis Jet, founded Aviation Portfolio in 2011. The company currently employs a staff of five and has offices in California and New York.

May we schedule five minutes to discuss?

Best Regards,

Luke Hatfield
