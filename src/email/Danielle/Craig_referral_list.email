Hi {!Contact.Goes_By__c},

Reaching out as I recently joined the Aviation Portfolio team after 10 years in the industry at NetJets and XOJET. It appears you know my partner/CEO, Craig Ross, via an introduction to our firm some time ago.

Aviation Portfolio is still the only independent advisory firm for private aviation consumers. Many current/loyal fractional and program clients choose to hire us. Perhaps a quick call in the next few days to understand why?

For brief background... The Aviation Portfolio team has a combined 60+ years of industry experience. Founder Craig Ross is the former COO of Marquis Jet/NetJets and I most recently ran sales as EVP for North America at XOJET (born into the industry via my parents, a Gulfstream G550 pilot and flight attendant pair at NetJets, where I started my career).

Best,
Danielle
