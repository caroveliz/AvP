Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As you may be seeing, the market is changing quickly given the impact of unprecedented demand. We work with fractional, lease, card, and jet membership clients where they leverage our independent subject matter expertise (no economic interest in who you work with). Aviation Portfolio clients appreciate our conflict-free guidance to max out the value with their providers.
 
Are you available for a quick chat in the next few days?

For brief backgroundâ€¦ The Aviation Portfolio team has a combined 60+ years of industry experience. Founder Craig Ross is the former COO of Marquis Jet/NetJets and I most recently ran sales as EVP for North America at XOJET (born into the industry via my parents, a Gulfstream G550 pilot and flight attendant pair at NetJets, where I started my career).

Best,
Danielle
