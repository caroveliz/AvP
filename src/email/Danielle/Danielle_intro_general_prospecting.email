Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As we approach year-end with special tax/FET exemptions and incentives across the myriad of solutions, many private flyers are turning to our strategic advisory team at Aviation Portfolio for unbiased guidance to help make optimal decisions that are cost-efficient and minimize risk.

Perhaps a quick call in the next few days to understand why?

For brief background... The Aviation Portfolio team has a combined 60+ years of industry experience. Founder Craig Ross is the former COO of Marquis Jet/NetJets and I most recently ran sales as EVP for North America at XOJET (born into the industry via my parents, a Gulfstream G550 pilot and flight attendant pair at NetJets, where I started my career).

Best,
Danielle
