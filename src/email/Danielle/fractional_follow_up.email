Hi {!Contact.Goes_By__c},

This is a great time to evaluate fractional contracts to max out the value. As an independent subject matter expert, we represent 100's of current NetJets/Flexjet fractional clients who value our conflict-free guidance.

Can we plan for a quick call in the next few days?

For brief background... The Aviation Portfolio team has a combined 60+ years of industry experience. Founder Craig Ross is the former COO of Marquis Jet/NetJets and I most recently ran sales as EVP for North America at XOJET (born into the industry via my parents, a Gulfstream G550 pilot and flight attendant pair at NetJets, where I started my career).

Best,
Danielle
